Plan:

Crucial Jobs:
 * Making a basic layout for our train and generate that with each train
 * Making the basic Train, Passenger, and Station classes
 * Create a train that can move across, stop at a station, and move towards the end of the line
 * Make a map with routes

Core Components:
Essential:
 * Moving train
 * Map with stations
 * Passenger counts
Non-essential:
 * Top down view of train
 * Moving Passengers

Prerequisites:
 * Station and routes
 * Stations to specialized stations and layouts

Delegation:
 Single:
    * Stations
    * Routes
 Group:
    * Trains
    * Moving the train and user interaction

Timeline:
 We found out how to create moving objects across a screen today, as well as how to display text on screen.
 We've roughly 1 week left, leaving us with time to address at least the most simplistic version of our train simulation.
