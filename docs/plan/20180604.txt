Plan:

Crucial Jobs:
 *  Create a train that can move across, stop at a station, and move towards the end of the line
 *	Make the stations interactive (being able to be selected)
 * 	Develop stack mechanism for placing people on and off the train
 * 	Develop timer for train in the station

Core Components:

Essential:

 * Passenger counts
 * Interactive map
 * Interactive way of placing people on the train
 
Non-essential:
 * Top down view of train
 * Making it look more professional and realistic
 * More routes and stations
 

Prerequisites:
 * 

Delegation:
 Single:
    * Timer for stations (Mohtasim)
	* Placing people on and off train (Jackie)
	* Macking stations interactive on map (Aidan)
	
 Group:
    * Coordinate multiple trains in the system
	* Establish how the program begins and ends. How a player wins and loses.

Timeline:
 By Tuesday, all of the essential components in this plan should be completed because the trains now have a consistent way of navigating across routes (as was completed over the weekend).
 Also by Tuesday the simple win and lose mechanism should be established because it directly follows the essential components.
 If there is a setback, Wednesday can accomodate,, especially since there is also no school Thursday.
