Plan:

Crucial Jobs:
 * Create a train that will move along the track and stop along each station
 * Upon reaching a station, a new screen will pop up with a station with 
passengers.
 * Allow the user to be able to drag customers to the train cars.
 * Keep track of the passengers as the simulation continues
 * A way for the simulation to end based on the goal (getting passengers to work on time).

Core Compponents:
Essential:

 * Passenger counts - Passengers exist now but they're not counted for each station nor by the trains
 * Stack implementation - Not completed. Passenger lines do exist though for the stack to be implemented on. 
 * User interaction - Dragging onto station not completed yet, however program detects when a passenger is selected.
 * Train stopping - Trains stop based on timer but this cannot be seen in the station screen.

Non-essential:

 * Top down view - there is a top-down view, however it does not reflect whether the train is on the station or not.
 * Ability to choose routes - Not done.
 * Bigger map and station - Map size increased but routes have not been expanded. 

Delegation:
 Single:
  * Have station screens and map screen sycnhronized. (Mohtasim)
  * Implement UI mechanism for placing passengers on trains using stacks and passenger counts (Aidan)
  * Expand routes and passenger limits for each station and train. (Jackie)
 Group:
  * Establish how the game begins and ends.
  * Make sure Trains, stations, and passengers are properly "talking" to each other.

Timeline:
 By end of Wednesday, have the user interaction ready as well as the train station
layout operational and synchronized with the map. Have the program be able to store the number of passengers
and change with each station. Have beginning and end for the simulation. This must be done by the end of Wednesday (NO EXCEPTIONS). Thankfully it clearly follows our most recent work. Thursday is for polishing.
