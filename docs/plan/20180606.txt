Plan:

Crucial Jobs:
 * Create a train that will move along the track and stop along each station
 * Upon reaching a station, a new screen will pop up with a station with 
passengers.
 * Allow the user to be able to drag customers to the train cars.
 * Keep track of the passengers as the simulation continues

Core Compponents:
Essential:

 * Passenger counts
 * User interaction
 * Train stopping

Non-essential:

 * Top down view
 * Ability to choose routes
 * Bigger map and station

Delegation:
 Single:
  * Timer for stations
  * Choosing/selecting routes
  * Making interaction with trains
 Group:
  * Implement all core components such as train stops, dragging passengers, 
and sotring passengers.

Timeline:
 By Wednesday, have the user interaction ready as well as the train station
layout operational. Have the program be able to store the number of passengers
and change with each station.
